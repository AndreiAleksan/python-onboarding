# Description

This repository was made to store a kind of "word counter". However, not only it reads words, but characters and lines as well. 

# How to run the project:

The program will ask for the path of the file. You must insert it (without quotation marks!). The output received will be the amount of words, characters and lines inside the file.

# TODO:

The "total words" counter doesn't work well if there are special characters between the words. Still trying to find a fix.
